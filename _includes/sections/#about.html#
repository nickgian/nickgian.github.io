<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About me</span></h1>

<div>
    <p>I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science advised by
    Professor <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw">David
    Walker</a>. My research interests revolve around programming
    languages and verification, and currently we are working on
    applying techniques from these fields (language design, static
    analysis tools etc.) to help network operators keep calm.</p>

    <p>
    Previously I worked with Professor
    <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/"> Andrew Appel</a> on
    the design of an operational semantics for concurrent languages
    suitable for end-to-end verification. We demonstrated the power of
    these semantics, by applying them to CompCert's C language in
       order to prove:
       <ul>
	 <li> the soundness of VST's concurrent separation logic </li>
	 <li> the correctness of CompCert with respect to a concurrent C program </li>
	 <li> and the absence of data-races in the resulting assembly program </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
