<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About me</span></h1>

<div>
    <p>I am a fifth year PhD student in the Computer Science department of
    Princeton University, advised by
    Professor <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw">David Walker</a>. My
    research interests revolve around programming languages, verification, and their applications in networked systems. During my PhD, I developed a language to model and automatically analyze a network's routing behavior (see <a href="https://nickgian.github.io/nv-pldi2020.pdf">NV</a>).
    Check out a recent <a href="https://netverify.fun/models-of-distributed-protocols/">blog post</a> 
    about some of our research on network verification.
    On top of NV, we built <a href="cav2019.pdf">Origami</a> a network
    compression tool to scale fault tolerance analysis to very large networks.

    Previously I worked with Professor
    <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/"> Andrew Appel</a> on
    the design of an operational semantics for concurrent languages
    suitable for end-to-end verification. We used these semantics to prove:
       <ul>
	 <li> the soundness of VST's concurrent separation logic </li>
	 <li> the correctness of CompCert with respect to a concurrent C program </li>
	 <li> and the absence of data-races in the resulting assembly program </li>
       </ul>
    </p>

   <p> Before Princeton, I obtained a <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=start">Masters in Computer Science</a> 
       as a student in ENS Cachan, and a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr">National Technical University of Athens</a>.
	   I have worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research, Amazon AWS, MPI-SWS, and INRIA.</p>
